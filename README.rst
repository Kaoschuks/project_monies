Project Monies--Where Have You Gone?
====================================

The aim of the project is to visualise expenditure to encourage better
management of money. The code parses bank statements supplied as text files
from Santander (international bank), and outputs some graphs (see below).


Prerequisites
=============
- Python 3+ (see requirements.txt file)


Key Features
============
- Convert a Santander bank statement .txt files into .csv format
- Search the .txt files for transactions based on a keyword

- Create two types of visualisation:

- Graph: Bar plot of the total expense per month for a category, for multiple
 categories.
- Uses: Find the month with the cheapest food ordering scheme.

- Graph: Total expense vs time, for multiple categories.
- Uses: Predict how many years needed to wait before buying some item, and
highlight the category with the highest expense so savings can be considered.
